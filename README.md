# GuitSet
GuitSet is an iOS application for storing and organizing chord sheets. After adding chord sheets
(manually or from the internet), you can organize your music into performance sets to make it easy
to perform a set in sequence. This app is like the [Ultimate Guitar app](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/),
but without online access for now. It's not $50/year, though, so that's nice.

## Getting started

To run the application, install XCode (requires macOS). Then, install [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)
and get dependencies using the following commands:

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod install
```

To open the project, open the file `GuitSet.xcworkspace` file created after installing dependencies.
Click `run` in XCode to start the application in Simulator.

## Why Does This Exist?

Once upon a time, there lived a bored programmer who wanted to make something cool. He thought building an
iOS app would be cool, and since he also liked performing music, he thought it would be useful to make an app
for managing his set lists. And so, he built an app. Stay tuned: one day, this could be a staple on the App
Store. Or maybe it'll be used as a paperweight. But it's software, so I guess it would be a virtual paperweight.
Super useful, right?
